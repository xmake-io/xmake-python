# xmake Python build system (PEP 517)

A python build system based on xmake to output sdist/wheel file respecting PEP517.

## Related Projects

Currently, the methods to build a python wheel containing C/C++ code are as
following:

- [distutils](http://pypi.org/project/distutils/): A simple C/C++ build system
  written in pure python. Before python 3.13, it is one of python standard
  libraries. Slow.
  - [setuptools](http://pypi.org/project/setuptools/): default python build
    system, which can use distutils to build python/C mixed project.
- [scons](https://pypi.org/project/SCons/): A C/C++ build system written in pure
  python. It is very slow. So Evan Martin, the maintainer of google chrome, has
  to create ninja and
  [switch](https://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/02/ninja.html)
  chrome's build system to ninja.
  - [enscons](https://pypi.org/project/enscons/): A python build system based
    on scons. Advantage: no extra dependency except python.
- [cmake](https://pypi.org/project/cmake/): A classic C/C++ build system. A
  standard in fact while bad-designed syntax.
  [scikit-build](https://github.com/scikit-build/) organization package it to
  PYPI to let python developer enjoy it. cmake in PYPI uses
  [ninja](https://pypi.org/project/ninja/) as its backend, which is also
  packaged by scikit-build organization. That means that python, cmake, ninja is
  needed. Although the latter two will be installed from PYPI.
  - [scikit-build](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-build/): first python build
    system based on cmake developed by scikit-build organization. Replaced by
    scikit-build-core.
  - [scikit-build-core](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-build-core/):
    scikit-build organization recommends it.
  - [cmeel](https://pypi.org/project/cmeel/): Another wheel.
  - [py-build-cmake](https://pypi.org/project/py-build-cmake/): Another wheel
    forked from [flit](https://pypi.org/project/flit/).
- [meson](https://pypi.org/project/meson/): A C/C++ build system written in pure
  python. However, it uses ninja as its backend.
  - [meson-python](https://pypi.org/project/meson-python/): A python build
    system based on meson.

Except slow distutils/scons, both cmake and meson use ninja as their backend. So
if a python developer want to build a python/C mixed project in high speed,
ninja is the only one choice. We hope xmake can be another choice -- it
should be as fast as ninja, as easy as meson, as powerful as cmake.

- [xmake](https://pypi.org/project/xmake-wheel):
  [package it](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-wheel/) to PYPI.
  - [xmake-python](https://pypi.org/project/xmake-python/): A python build system
    based on xmake. This project!

## Usage

`pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["xmake-python"]
build-backend = "xmake_python"
```

## Examples

- [examples](tests/examples)
- [xmake-wheel](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-wheel/)
- [gnumake-wheel](https://github.com/xmake-io/gnumake-wheel/)

## Introduction

Python build system support build sdist, wheel and editable installation.
According to [PEP517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/), python build system
is consist of two parts:

### Frontends

- `pyproject-build`/[`python -m build`](http://pypi.org/project/build/):
  standard realization.
- [`uv build`](https://pypi.org/project/uv/): the fastest frontend currently.
- [`pip wheel`](https://github.com/pypa/pip/): pip is an incomplete frontend
  because build sdist is still a
  [feature request](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3513).

In charge of:

- install required build dependencies from `build-system.requires`
- install optional build dependencies from the result of calling
  `build-system.build-backend`'s `get_requires_for_build_{sdist,wheel,editable}()`
- call `build-system.build-backend`'s `build_{sdist,wheel,editable}()`

### Backends

Refer
[some python build system backends](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#other-projects-for-building).

Many build systems are only used to build pure python wheels, such as
setuptools, flit-core, poetry, hatchling. And others can build python modules
written in C/C++/Fortran/Rust/etc. For the latter, scikit-build-core will search
and install pure python files automatically, without adding any related code to
`CMakeLists.txt`, meson-python is on the contrast. You must add code to
`meson.build`:

```meson
py = import('python').find_installation()
py.install_sources(
  [
    'src/example/__init__.py',
    'src/example/__main__.py',
  ],
  subdir: 'example',
)
```

This project is also like meson-python. You must add code to `xmake.lua`:

```lua
target("example")
set_kind("phony")
add_installfiles("src/example/*.py", {prefixdir= "$(pythondir)/example"})
```

Note, xmake supports glob expression which meson doesn't support.

Backend can install optional build dependencies. For example,
[scikit-build-core](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-build-core/)
will install [cmake](http://pypi.org/project/cmake) and [ninja](https://pypi.org/project/ninja/)
only when cmake and ninja are not found in `$PATH`.

We provide two python packages. One is a
[wheel for xmake](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-wheel/), like cmake and
ninja. Another is a python build system backend, which will install xmake wheel
when xmake is not found in `$PATH`.

Note xmake works needs `git`. Superisely, even if you
`echo 'echo 1' > /usr/bin/git && chmod +x /usr/bin/git`, xmake still can work
until it actually call git. And if you `add_package()` in your `xmake.lua`,
which download tools (curl, wget, ...) and extractors (tar, 7z or gzip, ...) are
all needed. Enough lucky, xmake will build git, 7zip, ... if needed. However, in
qemu and docker, the build will be very slow, So git had better be packaged to
PYPI, or expect users to install these tools by themselves.

### Wheel

Python package's format is wheel, which is a zip file naturally. If you try
create a wheel file named `example-0.0.1-cp313-cp313-linux_x86_64.whl`, it
optionally contains these files, and they will be installed to:

- python module, can be pure python files or dynamic linked library
  - `example.py`: `/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example.py`
  - `example/__init__.py`:
    `/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example/__init__.py`
  - `example.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`:
    `/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`
  - `example/_C.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`:
    `/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example/_C.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`
- attached data
  - `example-0.0.1.data/scripts/example`: `/usr/bin/example`
  - `example-0.0.1.data/headers/example.h`:
    `/usr/include/python3.13/example/example.h`
  - `example-0.0.1.data/data/other/data.txt`: `/usr/other/data.txt`
- metadata
  - `example-0.0.1.dist-info/WHEEL`:
    `/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example-0.0.1.dist-info/WHEEL`
  - `example-0.0.1.dist-info/METADATA`:
    `/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example-0.0.1.dist-info/METADATA`
  - `example-0.0.1.dist-info/RECORD`:
    `/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example-0.0.1.dist-info/RECORD`
  - `example-0.0.1.dist-info/licenses/LICENSE`:
    `/usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example-0.0.1.dist-info/licenses/LICENSE`

So we create a [xmake.lua](src/xmake_python/templates/xmake.lua), which defines
some variables, and when `xmake install -o/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXX`, they will be
some paths prefixed with `/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXX`, and finally packaged to:

- pythondir: `/platlib` -> `/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXX/platlib` -> `/`, like
  scikit-build-core's `SKBUILD_PLATLIB_DIR`
- bindir: `/data/bin` -> `/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXX/data/bin` ->
  `example-0.0.1.data/scripts/`, like scikit-build-core's `SKBUILD_SCRIPTS_DIR`
- includedir: `/data/include` -> `/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXX/data/include` ->
  `example-0.0.1.data/headers/`, like scikit-build-core's `SKBUILD_HEADERS_DIR`
- prefix: `/data` -> `/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXX/data` ->
  `example-0.0.1.data/data/`, like scikit-build-core's `SKBUILD_DATA_DIR`
- metadatadir: `/metadata` -> `/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXX/metadata` ->
  `example-0.0.1.dist-info/`, like scikit-build-core's `SKBUILD_METADATA_DIR`
- nulldir: `/null` -> `/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXX/null` -> will not be packaged, like
  scikit-build-core's `SKBUILD_NULL_DIR`

So you can create 3 kinds of wheels:

- pure python wheel, which named like `example-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl`,
  support any platforms and python 3 version.
- contains binary program, which named like
  `example-0.0.1-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl`, support fixed platforms, python3
  version. Because different OS and cpu cannot mix binary programs and
  dynamically linked libraries.
- dynamic linked python module, which named like
  `example-0.0.1-cp313-cp313-linux_x86_64.whl`, because dynamic linked python
  module links different python library like `/usr/lib/libpython3.13.so`.

We use the following method to judge the kind:

1. If all target's kinds are `phony` and don't use any package, the wheel
   is a pure python wheel.
2. Else if all targets don't use rule `python.*`, the wheel is a binary program
   wheel.
3. Else the wheel is a dynamic linked python module wheel.

### Cross Compilation

python project usually uses [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel)
to build wheels for all platforms. Github workflow has 3 types of machines.

- Ubuntu on amd64, used to build wheels for manylinux and musllinux
- macOS on arm64
- Windows on amd64

For manylinux (A GNU/Linux distribution forked from CentOS) and musllinux (A
musl/linux distribution forked from Alpine), it uses qemu to emulate different
CPUs and use docker to start the OS. For macOS and Windows, it use cross
compiler to build wheels for macOS on amd64 and Windows on arm64, etc. These
toolchains respect many environment variables:

- `ARCHFLAGS`: `-a XXX`. Specially, `-a arm64 -a x86_64` is for universal2.
- `VSCMD_ARG_TARGET_ARCH`: for Visual Studio's MSVC.

This project also detect them.

### Variables

All variables suffixed `dir` are kept, like autotools. Except above mentioned
`bindir`, `includedir`, `pythondir`, etc, the following variables are kept.

- `project_version`: project version
- `prefixdir`: string `data`, used to combine `prefix`: `/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXXX/data`
- `project_root`: temporary working directory like `/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXXX`
- `datadir`: `$(prefix)/share`, because it is usual.

### Autotools/Makefile

Except xmake, we also support classic GNU/Linux software build procedures:

```sh
autoreconf -vif
./configure
make
make install
```

The following build systems respect it:

- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)/
  [kati](https://github.com/google/kati/)
- [xmake.sh](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake.sh/)
- [autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

For autotools, you must include
[`variables.mak`](tests/examples/autotools/program/variables.mak) in your
`Makefile.am`.

## TODO

- [ ] get version from scm: `dynamic = ["version"]` in `pyproject.toml`
